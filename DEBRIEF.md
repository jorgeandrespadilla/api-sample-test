# Debrief

**1. Code Quality and Readability**

The functions inside `worker.js` should be broken down into smaller units/modules to improve readability and maintainability. Migrating to TypeScript will enhance type safety and reduce potential runtime errors. The code could also benefit from consistent error handling and retry mechanisms, implemented as shared utilities or middlewares to improve consistency.

**2. Project Architecture**

The project could benefit from applying a layered architecture to separate concerns into services, repositories, and controllers which would improve code structure. HubSpot API calls should be centralized through a dedicated service to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. This approach would also make the code more testable and easier to understand.

**3. Code Performance**

Implementing batch processing for database operations will improve efficiency. Leveraging parallel processing for HubSpot account data processing will reduce execution time. Minimizing redundant API calls will further enhance the overall worker performance.
